# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Project
This is the readme file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project through Coursera. The purpose is to demonstrate clear ability to obtain data and modify to create a tidy data set. The data used comes from the Human Activity Recognition and Smart Phone Data section of the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.

## Files

Run_analysis.R is a program that downloads the data from the UCI website, and then prepares the data to be outputted into its final form as Tidy_Data.txt.
It merges multiple data sets, modifies the names of each column, ses descriptive activity names to name the activities, extracts a subset of only the mean and standard deviation measurements and outputs the data to the final, Tidy_Data.txt file. 

CodeBook.md is a file that describes the steps taken, variables used, and transformations performed in the run_analysis.R file.

Tidy_Data.txt is the final data file with the appropriate table and values in one text file.
